         <p>
            In the admissions process, decisions are made with care to ensure all students offered admission to ZASS have the potential to be successful at our school, both in and out of the classroom. ZASS is committed to equality and inclusion and accommodates diversity in terms of family status, race, religion, disability, creed, color, ethnic origin or ancestry and gender.

        <h2>Admissibility</h2>
        <p>At ZASS, we value an education that will prepare all students for a rapidly changing world.  As a result, in addition to a history of academic success (grade reports and testing) that indicates the ability to succeed at ZASS, we look for the desired skills and dispositions demonstrated through the Character Assessment, Teacher Recommendations, and the Introductory Video. Together, these items help us paint a picture of each applicant that is unique, and one that allows us to determine the admissibility of each prospective student through a comprehensive and mission-driven lens</p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(0, 74, 143);">English Language Instruction</h2>
        <p>ZASS delivers an American curriculum  to students in English. Language proficiency in KG is not used as a criterion for admissions. In Elementary, Middle and High School, English language proficiency is assessed to ensure students can access the curriculum and progress to the best of their ability.</p>

    <div class="intro">
        <h2 style="color: rgb(0, 74, 143);">Additional Learning Requirements</h2>
        <p>ZASS is an inclusive school, for gifted students and those with additional educational needs. We provide differentiation and additional learning support based on the student's needs and academic levels. Parents should inform the school at the application stage regarding any additional learning support requirements for their child. We may request copies of external documents such as professional assessments, individual learning plans, and one-to-one learning requirements. Please be advised that extra learning support may incur additional costs to the parents.</p>
